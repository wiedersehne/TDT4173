    "For this problem, you will be implementing the K-Means algorithm. This is an unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering problems. That is, its objective is to produce a partitioning over a dataset without (explicit) external supervision of which group each datapoint should belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your initial implementation should be a standard K-means algorithm with Euclidean distance metric. A concise description can be found in [Andrew NG's lecture notes on K-Means](http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes2020spring/cs229-notes7a.pdf). The first part of Chapter 9 of _Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning_ by Christopher M. Bishop also gives a good overview of the algorithm, as well as its connection to the Expection Maximization (EM) algorithm.\n",

    "We have provided some skeleton code for the classifier, along with a couple of utility functions in the [k_means.py](./k_means.py) module. Please fill out the functions marked with `TODO` and feel free to add extra constructor arguments as you see fit (just make sure the default constructor solves the first dataset)."
